## 🎨 Customization

### Personalizing Your Portfolio

All the content of your portfolio can be customized by editing the files in the `data/` directory:

#### 1. Personal Information (`data/personal.ts`)

Update your identities and professional description:

```typescript
// Array of professional identities to display in the hero section
export const identities = [
  "a Developer 💻",
  "a Designer 🎨",
  // Add your own identities
];

// Professional description paragraphs for the hero section
export const professionalDescription = {
  paragraph1: "With X years of professional experience, I specialize in... [your main professional paragraph]",
  paragraph2: "Let's transform your ideas into reality! 🚀"
};
```

#### 2. Projects (`data/projects.ts`)

Showcase your projects by editing this file with your project details, including:
- Title, description, and image URL
- Technologies used
- GitHub repository and live site links

#### 3. Experience (`data/experience.ts`)

Edit your work experience history with:
- Company names, positions, and durations
- Responsibilities and achievements
- Company logos and links

#### 4. Certifications (`data/certifications.ts`)

Add your professional certifications:

```typescript
export const certifications: Certification[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Your Certification Name",
    issuer: "Certification Issuer",
    date: "Month Year",
    credlyBadgeId: "your-credly-badge-id" // From your Credly badge URL
  },
  // Add more certifications...
];
```

#### 5. Tech Stack (`data/tech-stack.ts`)

Update the technologies you're proficient in.

#### 6. Navigation (`data/navigation.ts`)

Customize the navigation menu items if needed.

### Setting Up Credly Badges

This portfolio uses local OpenBadge 3.0 PNG images instead of iFrames for Credly badges.
OpenBadge 3.0 is an open standard for verifiable digital credentials that includes transparent PNGs with embedded metadata about the achievement :

1. **Get your badge ID**: For each certification on Credly, get the badge ID from your public URL (e.g., `https://www.credly.com/badges/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j/public_url` → badge ID is `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j`)

2. **Download badge images**: 
   - Go to your Credly badge page
   - Click on "Share" and then "Download" to get the badge in OpenBadge 3.0 format
   - Save the transparent PNG with your badge ID as the filename (e.g., `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.png`)

3. **Add badges to your project**:
   - Place all badge PNG files in the `/public/credly-badges/` directory
   - Each badge should be named exactly with the badge ID and .png extension

### Adding Your Own Tech Icons

1. Place your SVG icons in the `public/floating-icons` directory
2. The icons will be automatically loaded and displayed in the background
3. Icons will inherit the floating animation and click interactions
4. For a large collection of tech icons, refer to [Tech Icons](https://techicons.dev/)

### Modifying Colors

The color scheme can be customized in the `tailwind.config.js` file:
```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      electricBlue: {...},
      circuitGreen: {...},
      steelGray: {...},
      brushedAluminum: {...}
    }
  }
}
```
